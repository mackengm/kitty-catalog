This catalog came about because we needed a way to keep track of all of the feral cats that live in and wander through our neighborhood. It's not an ideal place for cats to live, with cold winters and a massive highway close by, so we do what we can to keep them safe. If we find a new adult cat, we take it in to be spayed/neutered, and then re-release it around the house. This helps to at least lessen the burden that any future litters would have put on the existing feral cat community. Cats that have been caught, spayed/neutered, and released have their ear marked so that if caught again we don't try to re-spay or re-neuter. Kittens and cats that are calm enough to be adopted are taken to the animal shelter in Tama.

As of March 2020, we have caught 8 cats total:

  - Three kittens, all adopted.
  - 2 Female adults, both re-released.
  - 3 Male adults, two of which were re-released, and one that was put to sleep due to serious injury.
